Kinkscene is a wiki intended for members of the San Francisco kink community. It is only for people above 18. It contains information on many topics that may be helpful for people new to the city or the local kink scene.

These are links to "tag" pages that link out to a large number of topic pages. Think of them as jumping off points for subjects.

- [Events](/tags/events)
- [Education](/tags/education)
- [Play Spaces](/tags/venues)
- [Shopping](/tags/shopping)

Many events in San Francisco are open to people of all persuasions, but there are some events/venues/organizations that are intended for specific groups.

- [Lesbians](/tags/lesbian)
- [Gay Men](/tags/gay-men)
- [Transgender](/tags/transgender) people

Much of the information here is public knowledge, but we struggled to find a single resource to point new people to that organized everything into one place.

This wiki is a work in progress, if you see something that is missing or wrong, feel free to open an issue, pull request, or contact the site's administrator.
