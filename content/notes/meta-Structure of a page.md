Each page should begin with a short blurb describing the entry, followed by the following headings. All headings are optional as not all entries might have the same information.

- Events - organizations or venues may have recurring events that are enumerated here
- History - if the entry changed names/locations/ownership, or had other significant changes those should be enumerated here. Subject to [[meta-Archiving policy]]
- Vibes - if there are notable things people should know about the atmosphere of a place/event/group before going
- Links - links to external websites
	- Main website
	- Instagram
	- Fetlife

Contextually, other headings may make sense to add, but these are the most commonly used.
