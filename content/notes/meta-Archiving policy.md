Generally, when linking to external resources, we can link directly to them. For historical information however, it is necessary to use "archived" links for websites that either have been taken offline or may be taken offline in the future. This means that instead of linking to the content directly, we link to a timestamped snapshot of the content hosted by archivists. This means two things. First it allows us to view historical versions of websites that still exist, and it allows us to view websites that no longer exist. Both of which are very useful for historical research reasons.

All links under the "history" section of entries SHOULD be archived links for posterity.

All archival links SHOULD go through (unless only available through other archiver) the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org).
