Power Exchange is a sex club in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. It is not a BDSM-focused space, although BDSM is allowed there. The authors of this site have not personally been to Power Exchange, but we have heard exclusively bad things. It's a good place to go if you want someone to stare at you while masturbating and not leave you alone if you ask.

> We have heard "that place is creepy and gross" from men who are very, very active in the kink community. If you're a single woman, probably skip Power Exchange. If you are looking for a venue to do kink in public, maybe consider [[PlayXLand]] (note, PlayXLand does not allow sex) or a [[Release]] play party at [[Transform 1060]].
