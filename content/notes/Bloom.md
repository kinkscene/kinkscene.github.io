Bloom is an app for networking in "edge-of-culture communities" such as kink and polyamory. It is a hybrid between a dating app like Tinder and an events platform. It allows you to make a profile and connect directly with other people, or indicate your attendance at events and connect with other attendees.

Many of the kink organizations on this wiki have profiles and post their events on Bloom.
