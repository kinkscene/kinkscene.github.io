PlayXLand (pronounced "playland") is a BDSM event that occurs every Wednesday night at [[notes/Cat Club|Cat Club]]. Aside from being a normal bar serving alcohol with DJs, there is a limited play space in the back room where there are one or more sawhorse-style spanking benches, a St. Andrew's cross, a hardpoint on the ceiling for rope suspensions or spreader bars, and a set of house impact toys that can be used for scenes. Most people planning on playing come with a partner, but you can sometimes find partners for pickup play.

There is usually at least one person that does a rope suspension early in the night, many people doing impact play, and sometimes people will bring in electro toys such as violet wands, tasers and cattle prods.

# Rules
Cat Club is primarily a bar that serves alcohol, so it is bound by CA liquor control laws. You cannot actually have sex with anyone at PlayXLand, nor can you display any genitals (all genders must cover nipples and bottom bits).

In addition to the normal type of consent rules that you might expect to find at kink events, PlayXLand has a strict photo policy. There are no photographs allowed during the events, other than by the official staff photographers, who will always ask for explicit permission before taking pictures.
