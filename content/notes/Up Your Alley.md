Up Your Alley, also known as "Dore Alley" is a BDSM street fair in [[notes/South of Market|SoMa]]. It is run by the same organization that runs [[notes/Folsom St Fair|Folsom St Fair]]. Dore Alley is somewhat similar to Folsom St Fair, but it is smaller, more focused on gay men, and raunchier.

If you go to this, you will see lots of penises, you will see people having gay sex in public, and you will probably see people peeing on each other.
